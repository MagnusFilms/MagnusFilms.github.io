    <h1>Why did I create this?</h1>
    <p>I believe that the nice people at bethesda put alot of time and effort into the landscape and cities of their games, building a truly immersive experience far better than some other Developers who are only interested in how much money they can take from the player, and that many players dont truly experience the beauty of the landscapes of these games. Many players play the game soley for the mechanics and story, which is okay, but they never become immersed in the world of the game. That brings me to why i made this website. I believe that the true experience of these wonderful worlds is best experienced slowly, take your time while traversing the land, admire the views and avoid fast travel. fast travel has made players complacent, fast travelling to and from quests, and then walking in a straight line to the next quest marker, ignoring all the work put into the land. Every rock, tree, bush, house, ruin, mountain and farm were all strategically placed by the developers to build a world that makes everything feel alive. Many players ignore all of these wonderful features and go straight for the main quest, speeding through the game and not getting to know the world or people they are saving.</p>
